/**
 * @class Alloy
 * Top-level module for Alloy functions.
 *
 * Alloy is an application framework built on top of the Titanium SDK designed to help rapidly
 * develop high quality applications and reduce maintenance.
 *
 * Alloy uses the model-view-controller architecture to separate the application into three
 * components:
 *
 *  * **Models** provide the data of the application. Alloy utilizes **Backbone Model and Collection**
 *     objects for this functionality.
 *
 *  * **Views** provide the UI components to interact with the application, written using **XML markup**
 *    and **Titanium Stylesheets (TSS)**, which abstracts the UI components of the Titanium API.
 *
 *  * **Controllers** provide the glue layer between the Model and View components as well as
 *    additional application logic using the **Alloy API** and **Titanium API**.
 *
 * The API documentation provided here is used with Alloy Controllers and Widget Controllers to
 * interact with the View and Model components of the application or widget.
 *
 * For guides on using Alloy, see
 * [Alloy Framework](https://titaniumsdk.com/guide/Alloy_Framework).
