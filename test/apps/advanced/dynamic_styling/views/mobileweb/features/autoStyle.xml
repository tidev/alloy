	autoStyle is set to "false" here, but that is also the default behavior. All
	controllers are assumed to have autoStyle set to false, unless autoStyle is
	set to true in the config.json. autoStyle means that when a UI component is
	created, the apiName, classes, and id will be used not only to create the
	component at compile time, but also those values will be stored on the
	created proxy itself for later use as properties.

	To see exactly what is meant by "stored on the created proxy", check out the
	console log when this controller opens. It will show if the id, classes, and
	apiName are stored on each one of the ID'ed XML components below.

	Here's the specific reasons why you should or should not use autoStyle on a
	per-project (config.json), per-controller (<Alloy>), or per-component level.

	pros: Keeps track of apiName, classes, and id for all components. This
		  allows full use of the $.addClass() and $.removeClass() functions.
		  Without using autoStyle, all components created from XML would appear
		  to have no classes or apiName, despite having them listed as XML
	      attributes.
	cons: There is a small performance overhead with adding these properties to
		  every component. This is why autoStyle is not enabled for all
		  components by default. You should use autoStyle only on
		  components/controllers that will actually leverage the ability to
		  add/remove classes.

	You can see how these properties are made use of in the "Add/Remove Classes"
	section of this app.
